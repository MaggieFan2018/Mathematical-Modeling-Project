# Mathematical Model of Infection Mechanism of Bordetella

## Introduction
Central Dogma process explains how genetic information is transferred from DNA to protein through several steps such as DNA replication, transcription, translation, and protein production. This production of protein can be triggered by some environmental changes outside the cell. When the environmental signals outside fluctuates, the protein which are embeded on the cell membrane senses these signals and transfer this information further by activating another protein inside the cell called transcription factor. The transcription protein after getting activated by membrane protein then interacts with particular gene and trigger the protein that gene’s production. This protein then responses to the changes in the environment.

In this work we mathematically modelled the signal transduction and central dogma process of a bacteria called bordetella. Bordetella is genus of small (0.2-0.7 μm), Gram-negative coccobacilli of the phylum Proteobacteria. There are three closely related subspecies: B. bronchiseptica, B. parapertussis, B. pertussis and they are pathogenic in many hosts. Among these, B. pertussis is a strict human pathogen that is the causative agent of pertussis (whooping cough). Its natural habitat is in the human respiratory mucosa. Whooping Cough, or pertussis, is a respiratory infection in which a “whooping” sound is produced when the sufferer breathes.

Virulence factors are the proteins which are responsible for the infection in the host. In Bordetella there are four virulence proteins which are regulated by a protein system inside a cell called BvgAS. In its life time bordetella faces various types of environment and in response to that it changes the dynamics of virulence factors production so that it can effectively infect its host. Three types of environmental changes were considered in our model namely Bvg-, Bvgi and Bvg+, changes in these environemnt were modelled by changing the signal strength (S). Bvg-represents absence of signal, Bvg+ represents the signal strength is very high and Bvgi represents that the concentration of signal is intermediate.

In the presence of signal, the trans-membrane protein (BvgS) activates itself by attaching a phosphate group (PO4 -). This phosphate group is then travels through three domains of BvgS to ultimately activate another protein called BvgA (Figure 1). Once BvgA is activated to BvgA-P, it then acts as a transcription factor which regulates the protein production of all the virulence genes (Class 1 to Class 4) and also responsible for production of BvgAS system proteins (Positive feedback).

Each biochemical and genetic interaction can be considered to be a chemical reaction whose rate laws are written as described in method section in this report. In this project, we used stochastic simulation to solve these 20 “chemical reactions” equations as given in the paper. Gillespie algorithm was used to solve the system of equations which is decribed later in the methid section. We reproduced different results given in the paper by reproducing the dynamic plots of class 1-class 4 gene expressions.
